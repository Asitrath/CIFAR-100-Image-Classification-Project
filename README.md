# CIFAR-100-Image-Classification-Project
This repository contains an implementation of an image classification model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CIFAR-100 dataset is a widely-used benchmark for image classification algorithms, containing 100 classes with 600 images each (500 training images and 100 testing images per class).
